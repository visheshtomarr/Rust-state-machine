# Rust-state-machine: Basic Concepts for Blockchain Development
- This project is a Polkadot-SDK like state machine written from scratch in Rust.
- This project can be found on the [dotcodeschool.com](https://dotcodeschool.com/).
- Special thanks to [@shawntabrizi](https://github.com/shawntabrizi) for building this course to help others build a completely vanilla Rust project which does all the same tricks as the Polkadot SDK. 
- This course is a step-by-step guide to teach about the basics of Rust, Blockchain, and eventually the inner workings of the Polkadot SDK.
## How to run this project ?
- You can simply use *"cargo run"* in the root directory of this project which will give an output of the current state of this State Machine.
- To change the current state of this State Machine, we can add or remove extrinsics in our *"main"* function.
